# What is the differences between if , elif  if is consider the main condition elif allow you to check additional coditions if the previous coditions are false
# What is the differences between elif else elif is an additional condition want to be check - else the final condition if the all previous conditions are false 
# Can we use more than one elif ( yes)
# Can we use more than one else (no)
# write s simple ternary operator
# in elif , python will check all the conditions no matter what ? no the code will stop with the first true condition 
#in elif we use else for
